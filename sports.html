        Among various popular games across the world, football is one of the
        most enthusiastic and energetic sports. This game is played between two
        teams, and each team has eleven members. A lot of football tournaments
        are held in various countries every year at the national and
        international levels. Every four years, the FIFA or Federation
        Internationale de Football Association conducts a world cup which is the
        most awaited championship. The game is called football because the ball
        is passed among the team members using their feet, and the use of the
        hand is considered a foul. This, however, is decided by the referee of
        the match. The International Football Association Board formulates rules
        that the players follow, and any contravention shall be considered a
        disqualification.
